# The Apprentice

I've often wondered how formulaic The Apprentice UK can be from time to time. We get archetipical characters, consistent task categories with common mistakes, similar structure. How simply can we fully encapsulate the story that plays out in The Apprentice UK?

## Getting the data
My first try, when I first wanted to do this project, was to see what Chat GPT 3.x could infer from a simple prompt. At the time, x was such that this GPT hallucinated at some point mid response.
Luckily, the Wikipedia page for The Apprentice UK is a *highly* consistent formate. The URL, page structure, and even the structures of crucial tables are (virtually) identical. This makes it easy to scrape the data.

Check out my Notebook for the scraping tools so far.
